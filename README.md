## ðŸŽ¯ Refs & Portals

This section introduces two slightly more advanced React concepts: **Refs** and **Portals**.

### ðŸ”§ Whatâ€™s covered:
- How to use **Refs** to:
  - Access DOM elements directly
  - Manage non-state values
  - Expose component APIs (via `useImperativeHandle`)
- How to use **Portals** to render components outside of their parent DOM tree

### ðŸ§ª Practice Project:
A timer-based game where users must stop the timer at the right moment. The app is built using:
- Refs for input handling and logic
- Portals for modals and overlays
- Components and state for structure and interactivity

### ðŸ§° Starter Code:
- Includes a basic setup with an App component and a Player component
- Provided both as a local project and a CodeSandbox version
